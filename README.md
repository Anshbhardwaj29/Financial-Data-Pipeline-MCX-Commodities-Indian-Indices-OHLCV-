# Financial-Data-Pipeline-MCX-Commodities-Indian-Indices-OHLCV-
OverviewThis repository contains a robust Python-based ETL pipeline designed to fetch, clean, and structure high-frequency historical data for the Indian Market (MCX & NSE). The goal of this project is to provide "Analysis-Ready" datasets for algorithmic trading backtesting and market research.Assets CoveredCommodities (MCX): Gold & Silver (1-Minute Interval).Indices (NSE): Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, and FinNifty (1-Minute Interval).Time Period: October 2024 - February 2026.Key FeaturesAutomated Extraction: Integrated with Angel One SmartAPI to programmatically fetch historical candle data.Data Cleaning: * Handled missing intervals using forward-fill (ffill) logic to maintain time-series continuity.Removed duplicate timestamps and handled data overlaps during chunked processing.Standardized Output: All data is exported in standardized OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) format.Optimized Performance: Script logic handles large data chunks efficiently to ensure low memory footprint.Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries: Pandas, NumPy, Requests (for API), Datetime.API: Angel One SmartAPI (Connect).Data DictionaryColumnDescriptiontimeTimestamp in Indian Standard Time (IST)openOpening price of the 1-minute candlehighHighest price during the intervallowLowest price during the intervalcloseClosing price of the intervalvolumeTotal contracts/quantity traded
